## Project Description
We decided to analyze the trends in VR games over the past 13 years. 

### Introduction to Dataset:
This dataset brings together detailed information on VR games available on Steam, including metadata such as publishers, pricing, units sold, gross revenue, recommendations, and user engagement.
It is well-suited for analyzing trends in VR game design, identifying factors that influence player engagement, and understanding broader market dynamics. After cleaning the data sets, we were able to analyze the relationship between free and paid games in relation to their financial success and popularity.
### Key Area of Analysis:
- Marketshare of Free vs Paid Games
- Top Games Downloaded
- Marketshare by Developers
- Top Games based on Followers
- Games Popularity Over Time

### Data Cleaning
Data cleaning was an essential step needed in this dataset to ensure accuracy, consistency, and uasability for analysis. In this dataset there were missing values, incorrect data types, and inconsistencies. Before our Analysis we made sure that the data is clean and fully ready for use. 

## Key Findings
### Market Dominance:

#### 1. Paid games are more dominant than free games.

### Recommendations
- Since paid games are more popular among users, the developers and publishers should focus on developing paid games with good user experience and engaging methodology.​
- Having advertisement in games for revenue stream is not popular in the VR industry. ​
- Since there is a general declining popularity, if the pattern is declining after 2023, there is a strong need to introduce new innovation in the VR Games.
